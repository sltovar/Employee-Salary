# Employee-Salary
A two-class Java program that displays the yearly salary with a raise for two employees.

A class named Employee includes three private instance variables, first name (string), last name (string), and monthly salary (double). A constructor initializes the three instance variables. A set and get method is provided for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, the value is not set. 

The EmployeeSalary program demonstrates the Employee's class capabilities. Two Employee objects are created and each object's yearly salary is displayed. Then, each Employee is given a 20% raise and the yearly salary is displayed for each Employee again.
